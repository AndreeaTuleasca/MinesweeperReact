#Description
You can **generate** your own matrix by adding how many **bombs** you want to have, no of **rows** and **columns**.
Bombs will be placed randomly in the matrix. The game will end when you clicked on a bomb or when you discovered all clean cells.
You can also place flags on the cells that you think hide bombs. The number of **flags** will update, telling you how many you have already used. Score is not implemented yet, so don't count on it.
In order to restart the game, you need to click the **Generate**
